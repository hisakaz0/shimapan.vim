==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION                                            *shimapan-introduction*
This plugin 'shimapan' enable alternatively coloring like shima pants.  It's
helpful to you when you read the text which the width is almost determined
like csv file. You type `:ShimapanGo`, the file texts are colored each lines
alternatively('filetype' is change to 'shimapan'). When you disable the
coloring, you type `:ShimapanBye`.

The alternatively coloring is implemented by vim command, `:sign`.


INSTALL                                                 *shimapan-install*

This plugin does not support in less than 256 color. Lets install 256 color
version of vim. Already you use that vim, write folloing a command in your
.vimrc to enable this plugin. >
        set t_Co=256
<

Manual:

1. Get the plugin package from github,
    https://github.com/pinkienort/shimapan.vim
2. Put them in your Vim directory
3. Execute `:ShimapanGo` command when you want to enable, and else execute
`:ShimapanBye`

Package manager:

If you use a plugin manager, you can install from it also. In example,
   dein.vim is installed already, write following a command in your .vimrc. >
       call dein#add('pinkienort/shimapan.vim')
<

COMMANDS                                                *shimapan-commands*

:ShimapanGo                                             *:ShimapanGo*
        When you execute this commands, 'filetype' is changed 'shiampan' for
        current buffer, and each lines are colored alternatively according to
        the two variables `g:shimapan_first_color` and
        `g:shimapan_second_color`. Previous filetype is stored. when you type
        `:ShimapanBye`, filetype shimapan is discard and that filetype is set.

:ShimapanBye                                            *:ShimapanBye*
        When you execute the commands, alternatively coloring is finshed for
        current buffer, and original syntax highlighting are restored.


:ShimapanReload                                         *:ShimapanReload*
        When you execute this command, alternatively coloring are updated.
        shimapan.vim does not update automatically. When user want to update,
        the user have to execute this command. And two sign highlight settings
        for all of buffer which has filetype 'shimapan' will be updated
        according the following four variables, `g:shimapan_first_color`,
        `g:shimapan_second_color`, `g:shimapan_first_texticon`,
        `g:shimapan_second_texticon`. Default of above variables are described
        in section |shimapan-variables|.

MAPPINGS                                                *shimapan-mappings*

VARIABLES                                               *shimapan-variables*

                                                      *g:shimapan_first_color*
g:shimapan_first_color
        A first color is for alternatively coloring. In default, ctermfg is
        255 which is meant white, ctermbg is 26 which is meant blue. But
        the default setting is so high contrast. I recommend following
        example.

        Default: "ctermfg=255 ctermbg=26"

        >
        let g:shimapan_first_color  = "ctermbg=253 ctermbg=232"
        let g:shimapan_second_color = "ctermbg=255 ctermbg=234"
<

                                                     *g:shimapan_second_color*
g:shimapan_second_color
        A second color is for alternatively coloring. In default, cterm is set
        to reverse.

        Default: "cterm=reverse"

                                                   *g:shimapan_first_texticon*
g:shimapan_first_texticon
        A first texticon.

        Default: ">"

                                                  *g:shimapan_second_texticon*
g:shimapan_second_texticon

        Default: "<"
